Captain Game

Description

Captain Game is an exciting Android game developed using Jetpack Compose. The game challenges players to navigate through treacherous waters in search of treasures while avoiding storms. Players make strategic decisions on which direction to head (North, East, West, or South) and encounter random events that can either lead to finding a treasure or hitting a storm. The goal is to find as many treasures as possible while maintaining your health points.

Features

Treasures and Storms: Each directional choice may result in either finding a treasure or encountering a storm.
Health Management: Players start with 100 health points. Each storm encountered reduces health by 10 points.
Treasure Count: Players keep track of the number of treasures found.
Random Events: The outcomes of each directional choice are randomized, making each game session unique.
Game Over and Restart: The game ends when health points reach zero, but players have the option to restart and try again.
How to Play

Random Events: Each choice results in a random event:
